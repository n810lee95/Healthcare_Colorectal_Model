# Colorectal Cancer Prediction Model

## Business Problem
Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cancer. Application of prediction models can provide insights on the most useful indicatars for survival and mortality. 

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Size: 167,497 Cases
- Features: Age, sex, tumor characteristics, lab values
- Outcome: Mortality

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Development:
   - Decision Tree Classifier
4. Model Evaluation & Interpretation

## Results
- **Best Model:** Decision Tree Classifier
- **Accuracy:** 60%
- **F1-Score:** 0.7461719559280535
